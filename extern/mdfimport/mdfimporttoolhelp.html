         </div>
         <h2>Starting the tool<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>To open the MDF import tool, type <tt>mdfimport</tt> at the command line, with no arguments.
         </p>
         <h2>Opening an MDF File<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>From the <b>MDF File</b> menu, select <b>Open MDF File...</b>. Use the dialog that appears to browse and select an MDF (<tt>.dat</tt> or <tt>.mdf</tt>) file. After an MDF file has been selected, the names of all available signals will appear in the <b>Unselected signals</b> list in the <b>Select Signals</b> panel. The name of the MDF file is also listed at the top of this panel.
         </p>
         <p>The available signal names shown are the 'long' names and are displayed with the device names hidden by default. If you want
            to see the device names, uncheck the <b>Hide device names</b> check box below this <b>Unselected signals</b> list. The device names are always removed from the signal names when the variables are created in the workspace. The names
            are also appended with textual information from the MDF file about the sample rate of the signal. It is usually a string such
            as '125ms' but can also a string like 'Cly Event' or 'Synchro' for asynchronously sampled signals.
         </p>
         <h2>Selecting signals<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>You specify a signal for importing by selecting it from the <b>Unselected signals</b> list with the mouse then pressing the '&gt;' button. This will move it to the <b>Selected signals</b> list.  You can use the ctrl and shift keys to make multiple selections. You can select all signals with the '&gt;&gt;' button.
            You can unselect signals from the <b>Selected signals</b> list, returning them to the <b>Unselected signals</b> list in a similar way using the '&lt;' and '&lt;&lt;' buttons.
         </p>
         <h2>Importing the signals<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>You import the selected signals by pressing the <b>Import signals</b> button in the lower right corner. All signals will be loaded into the MATLAB workspace by default as individual column vector
            variables. By default, each variable name is appended with <tt>_N</tt> where <tt>N</tt>, usually in the range 1 to 5, denotes one of the sampling rates in the MDF file. A time vector variable <tt>time_N</tt> is also created in the workspace and contains the associated sample times of the signal. The time vector can be used for
            plotting the signal against time correctly or to provide the timing information for a Simulink "From Workspace" block.
         </p>
         <h2>Signal Import Options<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>You can import the generated signals into a MAT-File instead. Go to the <b>Signal Import Options</b>  panel. Then in the <b>Import signals to:</b> option, choose <b>MAT-File</b>. After pressing the <b>Import signal(s)</b> button, choose the name of a MAT-file in the browser that appears. The name defaults to the MDF filename with the <tt>.mat</tt> suffix instead.
         </p>
         <p>You can differentiate variables and time vectors of different sample rates by having them appended with a string representing
            the sample rate (e.g. <tt>_10ms</tt>) instead of a rate number. To do this, choose <b>rate string</b> in the <b>Differentiate rates by appending variable names with</b> option. This is useful if the tool generating the MDF file changes the rate number between different tests, making it difficult
            to compare the variables.
         </p>
         <p>You can also append variable names with additional text. This can be useful if you want to differentiate the same set of data
            from multiple different sessions, simulation runs or experiments. To do this add any text into the edit box labeled <b>Append variable names with additional text</b>.
         </p>
         <h2>Creating a signal selection file<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>You can save the list of signals you selected in a file for use again. From the <b>Signal Selection File</b> menu, select <b>Create Signal Selection File...</b>. This brings up a dialog to allow you to locate a directory and text file to store the selected signal names.
         </p>
         <h2>Using a signal selection file<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>You can open a previously stored signal selection file before or after you have loaded an MDF file. From the <b>Signal Selection File</b> menu, select <b>Open Signal Selection File...</b>. Use the dialog that appears to browse and select a <tt>.txt</tt> file.
         </p>
         <p>If an MDF file is currently loaded, the signals will be selected immediately. Any signals not found in the currently loaded
            MDF file with be listed in the command window.
         </p>
         <p>If an MDF file is not currently loaded yet, the requested signals from the signal selection file will be shown in italics
            in the <b>Selected signals</b> list. Then when an MDF file is loaded, the signals will be selected and any signals not found in the MDF file with be listed
            in the command window. If you do not clear the signal selection file, the signal selection will remain active and be applied
            to each MDF file loaded. This provides a method of selecting the same signals in multiple MDF files.
         </p>
         <p>The signal selection file can be edited or manually created with the signal names you want to select. The MDF Import tool
            selects signals with names (with device names removed) that exactly match the strings in the signal selection file.
         </p>
         <h2>Changing the created time vectors<a name="9"></a></h2>
         <p>Although signals in an MDF file have a nominal sample rate, e.g. 125ms, in practice, the sampling is non-uniform and thus
            the time vectors generated are non-uniform. You can generate uniform time vectors by choosing <b>Create ideal uniform time vectors</b> in the <b>Time Vector Generation</b> panel.
         </p>
         <p>The 1-5 different sample rates used in the selected signals are displayed in the <b>Selected rates</b> list. This list shows the textual information about the samepl rates of the signals (e.g. 125ms) together with the actual
            numerical value of the sample rate (e.g. 0.125). You can override a rate by selecting it and changing its value in the <b>New sample rate</b> edit box to the right.
         </p>
         <h2>Clearing MDF and signal selection files<a name="11"></a></h2>
         <p>From the <b>MDF File</b> or <b>Signal Selection File</b> menu, select <b>Clear</b>.
         </p>
         <h2>Generating command line equivalent<a name="12"></a></h2>
         <p>You can generate the command line equivalent call to <tt>mdfimport</tt> with appropriate parameters, based on the current options set in the GUI tool. This is useful in automating tasks in a script
            such as importing many files. See separate <a href="mdfimportfunctionhelp.html">MDF import function help</a> for examples of using <tt>mdfimport</tt> as a function/command.
         </p>
         <p>Choose the <b>Command Generation</b> menu and select <b>Generate</b>. The command line equivalent is displayed in the command window. Copy and paste this into the command window or an M-file
            to run. If there are many signals selected, you can replace long the list of names with a signal selection file (see "Creating
            a signal selection file" earlier in this document). If all signals are selected, the signal selection parameter is set to
            the default <tt>[]</tt> meaning import all signals.

%% MDF Import Tool Help
% This document describes how to import MDF files with the |mdfimport|
% tool. To learn how to call |mdfimport| as a function,  see separate
% <mdfimportfunctionhelp.html MDF import function help>.

%% Starting the tool
% To open the MDF import tool, type |mdfimport| at the command line, with
% no arguments. 

%% Opening an MDF File
% From the *MDF File* menu, select *Open MDF File...*. Use the dialog that
% appears to browse and select an MDF (|.dat| or |.mdf|) file. After an MDF file has
% been selected, the names of all available signals will appear in the
% *Unselected signals* list in the *Select Signals* panel. The name of the
% MDF file is also listed at the top of this panel.

%%
% The available signal names shown are the 'long' names and are displayed
% with the device names hidden by default. If you want to see the device
% names, uncheck the *Hide device names* check box below this *Unselected
% signals* list. The device names are always removed from the signal names
% when the variables are created in the workspace. The names are also
% appended with textual information from the MDF file about the sample rate
% of the signal. It is usually a string such as '125ms' but can also a
% string like 'Cly Event' or 'Synchro' for asynchronously sampled signals.

%% Selecting signals 
% You specify a signal for importing by selecting it from the *Unselected
% signals* list with the mouse then pressing the '>' button. This will move
% it to the *Selected signals* list.  You can use the ctrl and shift keys
% to make multiple selections. You can select all signals with the '>>'
% button. You can unselect signals from the *Selected signals* list,
% returning them to the *Unselected signals* list in a similar way using
% the '<' and '<<' buttons.

%% Importing the signals
% You import the selected signals by pressing the *Import signals* button
% in the lower right corner. All signals will be loaded into the MATLAB
% workspace by default as individual column vector variables. By default,
% each variable name is appended with |_N| where |N|, usually in the range
% 1 to 5, denotes one of the sampling rates in the MDF file. A time vector
% variable |time_N| is also created in the workspace and contains the
% associated sample times of the signal. The time vector can be used for
% plotting the signal against time correctly or to provide the timing
% information for a Simulink "From Workspace" block.

%% Signal Import Options
% You can import the generated signals into a MAT-File instead. Go to the
% *Signal Import Options*  panel. Then in the *Import signals to:* option,
% choose *MAT-File*. After pressing the *Import signal(s)* button, choose
% the name of a MAT-file in the browser that appears. The name defaults to
% the MDF filename with the |.mat| suffix instead.
%
% You can differentiate variables and time vectors of different sample
% rates by having them appended with a string representing the sample rate
% (e.g. |_10ms|) instead of a rate number. To do this, choose *rate string* in
% the *Differentiate rates by appending variable names with* option. This
% is useful if the tool generating the MDF file changes the rate number
% between different tests, making it difficult to compare the variables.
%
% You can also append variable names with additional text. This can be
% useful if you want to differentiate the same set of data from multiple
% different sessions, simulation runs or experiments. To do this add any
% text into the edit box labeled *Append variable names with additional
% text*.

%% Creating a signal selection file
% You can save the list of signals you selected in a file for use again.
% From the *Signal Selection File* menu, select *Create Signal Selection
% File...*. This brings up a dialog to allow you to locate a directory and
% text file to store the selected signal names. 

%% Using a signal selection file
% You can open a previously stored signal selection file before or after
% you have loaded an MDF file. From the *Signal Selection File* menu,
% select *Open Signal Selection File...*. Use the dialog that appears to
% browse and select a |.txt| file.
% 
% If an MDF file is currently loaded, the signals will be selected
% immediately. Any signals not found in the currently loaded MDF file with
% be listed in the command window.
%
% If an MDF file is not currently loaded yet, the requested signals from
% the signal selection file will be shown in italics in the *Selected
% signals* list. Then when an MDF file is loaded, the signals will be
% selected and any signals not found in the MDF file with be listed in the
% command window. If you do not clear the signal selection file, the
% signal selection will remain active and be applied to each MDF file
% loaded. This provides a method of selecting the same signals in multiple MDF
% files.
%
% The signal selection file can be edited or manually created with the
% signal names you want to select. The MDF Import tool selects signals with
% names (with device names removed) that exactly match the strings in the
% signal selection file.

%% Changing the created time vectors
% Although signals in an MDF file have a nominal sample rate, e.g. 125ms,
% in practice, the sampling is non-uniform and thus the time vectors
% generated are non-uniform. You can generate uniform time vectors by
% choosing *Create ideal uniform time vectors* in the *Time Vector
% Generation* panel.

%% 
% The 1-5 different sample rates used in the selected signals are displayed
% in the *Selected rates* list. This list shows the textual information
% about the samepl rates of the signals (e.g. 125ms) together with the
% actual numerical value of the sample rate (e.g. 0.125). You can override
% a rate by selecting it and changing its value in the *New sample rate*
% edit box to the right.

%% Clearing MDF and signal selection files
% From the *MDF File* or *Signal Selection File* menu, select *Clear*.

%% Generating command line equivalent
% 
% You can generate the command line equivalent call to |mdfimport| with
% appropriate parameters, based on the current options set in the GUI tool.
% This is useful in automating tasks in a script such as importing many
% files. See separate <mdfimportfunctionhelp.html MDF import function help>
% for examples of using |mdfimport| as a function/command.
% 
% Choose the *Command Generation* menu and select *Generate*. The command
% line equivalent is displayed in the command window. Copy and paste this
% into the command window or an M-file to run. If there are many signals
% selected, you can replace long the list of names with a signal
% selection file (see "Creating a signal selection file" earlier in this
% document). If all signals are selected, the signal selection parameter
% is set to the default |[]| meaning import all signals. 

%% Appendix
%
% *Known limitations* 

%%
% * This tool has only been tested with MDF files generated by ETAS INCA. 
% * You cannot load signals from "unsorted" MDF files.
% * You cannot load signals with names greater that 64 characters. The
% conversion of illegal variable characters like '.' and '\' to legal
% characters (see below) will make names longer.
% * You cannot load signals in data blocks containing byte arrays.
% * You can only
% load signals with conversion formulae type 0, 1, 2, 6, 10 (assuming 'x' as variable), 11, 12, 65535.
% * Only MDF files with data from one device is supported. The work around is
% to store data from more than one device in sepertate MDF files.

%%
% *Signal name creation*

%%
% As variables are created for each signal, legal MATLAB variable names
% must be created from the signal names. This is done by converting illegal
% characters to legal character combinations and by optionally adding an
% |'x'| to the start when signal names begin with numbers. The convertion
% process can be customized by modifying the |mygenvarname| subfunction
% inside |mdfimport|. The following illegal characters are converted as
% shown:

%%
% * |'\'| replaced with |'_bs_'|
% * |'/'| replaced with |'_fs_'|
% * |'['| replaced with |'_ls_'|
% * |']'| replaced with |'_rs_'|
% * |'('| replaced with |'_lp_'|
% * |')'| replaced with |'_rp_'|
% * |':'| replaced with |'_co_'|
% * |'-'| replaced with |'_hy_'|
% * |' '| (space) replaced with |'_'|
% * |'.'| replaced with |'p'|
% * |'$'| replaced with |'S_'|
